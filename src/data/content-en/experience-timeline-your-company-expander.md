My main passion is to develop, enhance and implement interface and interaction
designs.

I have experience with developing usability research based task flows and
scenarios. In order to develop wireframes, interaction flows and prototypes I
substantiate my decisions through qualitative and quantitative data and creative
and critical thinking.

As a front-end developer I offer an extensive knowledge of Javascript, jQuery,
AJAX and supplementary libraries. I am skillful in developing semantic and
accessible content through HTML5, ARIA/WCAG and microdata and formats.
Visualising responsive designs using CSS, Sass, LESS is my second nature.

My codebase is Git versioned, cross browser/device compatible and is compiled
with NPM scripts, Gulp or Webpack.

I am a people-oriented, social person who is creative in thinking and acting and
has a great sense of responsibility.
