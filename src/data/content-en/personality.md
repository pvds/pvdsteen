**HEXACO** is a six-factor model of personality measured by the HEXACO-PI-R.
Your report shows **scale scores** (1–7; average ≈ **5.00**) and **percentiles**
(your standing vs. a comparison group). Uppercase labels are the six broad
**factors**; the four lowercase traits under each are **facets**. There’s also
an interstitial facet, **Altruism**, linked to three factors.

- **Percentiles** tell you what % of the sample scored **below** you (e.g., 90th
  = higher than 90% of people).
- **Scale scores** are centered so most people fall between **4.00–6.00**.
- **Not “better” vs. “worse”:** high/low ends reflect **style**, not moral
  value, and could be named either way (e.g., Extraversion vs. Introversion).
