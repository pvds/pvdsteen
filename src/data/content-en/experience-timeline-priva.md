As FE/UX development specialist at Priva I am a member of the UX team and design
system guild.

Working closely with both UX designers and our app development teams I provide a
holistic view on developing our [design system](https://design.priva.com). I
bridge the gap between design and development and take the lead in setting up
processes, standard, tooling and documentation. Besides this I educate FE
developers on the UI development specialism through reviews, direct support,
courses and workshops.
