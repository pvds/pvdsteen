My main interest lies in the **combination of user experience design and
front-end development**, focusing on critical and creative thinking I am
developing myself in the areas of Interaction Design, Information Architecture
and Interface Design. Developing task flows, personas and scenarios based on
research of user needs in order to construct wireframes, prototypes and perform
usability studies.

In order to support my knowledge, skills and experience I am **constantly
improving myself in various supporting disciplines**: Human Computer
Interaction, Cognitive Science, Heuristics, Micro Expressions and Usability
Engineering.
