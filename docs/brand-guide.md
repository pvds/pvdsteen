## 1. Introduction & Brand Identity

**Brand Name**  
Peter van der Steen

**Tagline**

**Who We Are**

### My Mission

### My Vision

Cultivate an inclusive, empathetic, and growth-focused space that supports
clients’ emotional well-being and self-discovery.

- **Inclusivity & Accessibility**  
  I welcome clients from all cultural backgrounds, offering specialized support
  for internationals and expats while remaining open and beneficial to everyone.

  empowering them with tools that promote sustainable well-being and growth.

  client to be their full self in a supportive, non-judgmental environment.

   I balance reflective exploration with real-life strategies, encouraging
   curiosity about how small shifts can lead to meaningful progress.

   communities—and value the importance of these contexts in creating positive
   change.

## 2. Logo Usage

While I maintain a primarily personal, human-centered brand, I also adhere to
professional design standards. If you use or develop a logo (like a friendly,
rounded Tree of Life):

- **Primary Logo**: A calm, approachable Tree of Life design that reflects
  growth and connection.
- **Clear Space**: Maintain generous space around the logo for legibility.
- **Variations**:
    - Single-color (Charcoal Gray) for print or simplified use
    - Monochrome or inverted versions for darker backgrounds
- **Minimum Size**: Keep the logo large enough so all details remain clear.

## 3. Color Palette

My color palette balances warmth with calm professionalism. Each hue resonates
with the brand’s values of empathy, growth, and inclusion.

### Colors

1. **Brand Blueish**
    - HEX: `#359BB7`
    - **Usage**: Large backgrounds, primary brand color

2. **Accent Greenish**
    - HEX: `#61A188`
    - **Usage**: Supporting backgrounds, subtle highlights

3. **Terracotta**
    - HEX: `#D6A756`
    - **Usage**: Call-to-action buttons or interactive elements

### Usage Guidance

- Pair Charcoal Gray text with lighter backgrounds.
- Use Terracotta sparingly for key CTAs to draw immediate attention.

## 4. Typography

**Typeface**: **Quicksand** (Weights: 300, 400, 500, 600, 700)

- **Headlines (H1–H3)**
    - Bold (700), more prominent sizes
    - Clear, concise text to convey empathy and approachability
- **Body Text & Paragraphs**
    - Regular (400), with comfortable line spacing for readability
- **Subheads/Emphasis**
    - Semi-Bold (600) to differentiate subsections or highlight key points

### Responsive Rules

- Scale down headline sizes on smaller screens to avoid overflow.
- Maintain comfortable line heights for readability across devices.

## 5. Iconography & Imagery

### Iconography

- **Style**: Rounded, minimal icons reflecting a natural or growth-oriented
  aesthetic (matching the concept of a Tree of Life).
- **Use**:
    - Smaller icons for inline actions or bullet points
    - Larger icons for hero sections or important features
- **Colors**: Align icon colors with brand accents (Brand Blueish or Accent
  Greenish) to maintain consistency.

### Photography

- **Mood**: Warm, natural images that evoke empathy, calm, and diversity
- **Content**: Realistic settings, diverse individuals, or nature-inspired
  visuals that align with the brand’s supportive, welcoming vibe
- **Emphasis**: Show authentic moments (e.g., people in conversation, personal
  reflections) to reflect the relatable, personal nature of therapy

---

## 6. Motion & Interaction

- **General Principle**: Subtle, purposeful animations that feel supportive
  rather than distracting
- **Transitions**:
    - Keep durations short (under 300ms) with gentle easing
    - Fade or crossfade page transitions
- **Hover & Focus**:
    - Subtle color transitions or a faint shadow
    - Minimal or no scaling to avoid disorientation

---

## 7. Grid & Layout

- **Grid System**: A flexible 12-column structure that adapts to smaller
  devices, possibly shifting to fewer columns.
- **Spacing**: Use consistent units (multiples of 4 or 8) to maintain a calm,
  uncluttered look.
- **Responsive Breakpoints**:
    - Mobile-first approach, scaling up for tablets and desktops
    - Keep whitespace ample for a serene, welcoming feel

## 8. Tone of Voice & Copy Guidelines

### Overall Style

- **First Person**: I speak directly from my own perspective (“I,” “my,” “let’s
  explore”).
- **Second Person**: Address the client as “you,” fostering direct engagement
  and empathy.
- **Personality**: Empathetic, supportive, and approachable. A calm and
  nurturing voice that resonates with clients seeking therapy.

### Example Phrasing

- “I’m here to help you discover new perspectives.”
- “Let’s work together to find meaningful change.”

### Best Practices

- **Warmth & Encouragement**: Convey genuine care— “I understand,” “Let’s
  explore how we can…”
- **Clarity Over Jargon**: Avoid overly clinical terms unless necessary; break
  down complex ideas.
- **Concise Paragraphs**: Short paragraphs and bullet points support easy
  reading.
- **Active Voice**: “I help you” rather than “You are helped by me.”

---

## 9. Accessibility

- **Color & Contrast**: Ensure text contrast is high enough against backgrounds.
- **Reduced Motion**: Provide or respect user settings to disable nonessential
  animations.
- **Clear Labels & Instructions**: For forms, make sure labels and error
  messages are accessible to screen readers.

---

## 10. Future Adaptability

- **Theme Variations**: Potential introduction of a dark mode or high-contrast
  theme if needed, while retaining the brand’s core color references.
- **Video & Print**: Maintain consistent visuals and voice for any potential
  printed materials, presentations, or videos.
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: I will regularly update this guide as the brand
  grows, ensuring alignment across every channel.
