        knowledge</strong> of
        front-end development and user experience design <strong>in order to create engaging, but above
        all user friendly
        products and services</strong>.

      content: '<p>
        My main interest lies in the <strong>combination of user experience design and front-end
        development</strong>, focusing on critical and creative thinking I am developing myself in the areas of
        Interaction Design, Information Architecture and Interface Design. Developing task flows, personas and
        scenarios based on research of user needs in order to construct wireframes, prototypes and perform usability
        studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to support my knowledge, skills and experience I am <strong>constantly improving myself in various

          I have experience with developing usability research based task flows and scenarios.
          In order to develop wireframes, interaction flows and prototypes I substantiate my decisions through qualitative and quantitative data and creative and critical thinking.

          As a front-end developer I offer an extensive knowledge of Javascript, jQuery, AJAX and supplementary libraries.
          I am skillful in developing semantic and accessible content through HTML5, ARIA/WCAG and microdata and formats.
          Visualising responsive designs using CSS, Sass, LESS is my second nature.

          My codebase is Git versioned, cross browser/device compatible and is compiled with NPM scripts, Gulp or Webpack.
